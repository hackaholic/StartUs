Suppose we have an access.log web server. How do I use the standard console 
tools to find ten IP addresses from which there were most requests?


Using awk:
awk '{arr[$1]++}END{for(var in arr){print var, arr[var]}}' access.log | sort -k 2n | tail -n 10


Using python:
Please check python program ipRequestCount.py
